# Typhon
## Python with Types (and compiled)

If you have ever programmed Python in your life, you may have noticed that it is insanely slow, not strictly typed and interpreted.

But this is about to change with this incredible "Typhon" / Python Compiler.

## The Goals

- Make a Programming Language which feels similar to Python but runs as fast as C
- Make it not interpreted and typed
- Maybe at some point object oriented (hmmm)
